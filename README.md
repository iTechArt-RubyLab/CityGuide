The CityGuide project is designed to build routes in the city of St.Petersburg

- The most interesting task in the project is working with maps, since the project has 4 different maps that implement different functionality(displaying the location of an organization with a marker, creating a new location with a movable marker, displaying all organizations on a map, creating a route). This was my first work with Google Maps

- The most difficult task for me was to distribute my tasks in order of importance and plan my time correctly

- At the next stage of development, I would add a rating to organizations and automatically block those organizations that have a low rating.I would also like to add standard routes for users that he can book, and not create on his own.I would also like to improve the speed of the application, change the loading of images and their editing
